{{< /lead >}}

Hello, my name is Mohamed Allam. I am a self taught software developer, foremerly PHP & Laravel [(My Laravel blog)](https://laravelexample.com/), and currently [Go](https://go.dev/), and system programming. I am very passionate about cutting edge technologies, using them to solve real world problems.

I enjoy teaching everything I know about code, [documenting](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) my jouney [(versus content create)](https://garyvaynerchuk.com/creating-content-that-builds-your-personal-brand/), I love teaching on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@MohamedAllamTech/) as well, as this [blog](/blog/), algorithms and data structure are my playground. I also help professionals and companies to build their softwares, and I am open to give private lessons to students and enthousiasts. This in parallel with my interest to help [free & open source projects](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html), which has been a beautiful journey.

I breath *`O_RDWR`* code, I would eat and act like a human being. in my free time.
